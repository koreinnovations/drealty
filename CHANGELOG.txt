7.x-3.0-beta2 - 04-03-2012

+ Issue [#1512700] by Kevin Quillen. Squash Pathauto Entity / Alias bug for good. Using new Entity() vs. entity_create() was causing Pathauot Entity to create duplicate alias entries.
+ Issue [#1512618] by Kevin Quillen. daemon import errors.  The default query function had a bad variable name, $item vs. $listing, which was not allowing listings to be imported correctly.
+ Added a $count variable to the import offset counter.
+ Improved the process_images() function. Added better error handling, logging, and some performance / memory management enhancements.
+ Issue [#1512576] by mgriebe. Test DMQL query not working. This is now working.
+ Issue [#1512780] by Kevin Quillen. Undefined offset error in drealty.daemon.php. This was caused by a logging function that was calculating a 'pretty' format for the number of bytes that were downloaded for image data. The function was removed.
+ Fixed issue where listings that did not have images in the MLS were not being properly marked as processed by the process_images() function.
+ Added new drush command: "rets-process-images" that will process any listings that are marked to process images, this is a utility function and probably won't be used by many.
