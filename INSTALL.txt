INSTALLATION
------------

REQUIRED MODULES: Field, Entity API (dev)

1. Download and copy dRealty to your sites/SITENAME/modules directory. Do the same for Entity API.

2. Enable Entity API module, and all Field modules.

3. Download phRETS from http://troda.com/projects/phrets/index.php?title=Download. phRETS is a php wrapper required to talk to RETS servers.

4. Place phRETS in your libraries folder like so: sites/all/libraries/phRets/phRets.php.

5. Enable dRealty module.

6. Go to admin/drealty and select Drealty Connections.

7. Configure your initial connection (your RETS provider) and Activate it.

8. Go back to admin/drealty/ and select Drealty Property Types. 'Property Types' are actually bundles we are creating, like Content Types.

9. Create a Property Type, for example, Residential.

10. The following screen looks just like a Content Type screen. dRealty works with Fields in core, so simply start adding the fields you want to have on this property type bundle. For example, create a Price field as Integer. On the next screen, dRealty will allow you to 'map' the field to its RETS equivalent. Start typing 'price' in the mapping input- it will autocomplete and find results for you, and select the Price field. For example, in Innovia systems, it will be ListPrice. 

11. Repeat step 10 for all relevant fields you want to capture.

12. 


GEOCODING
---------

The Location module for Drupal 7 does not support entities other than nodes (link). We recommend using AddressField, GeoField, and Geocoder modules to have listings geocoded when imported. These modules work great with Views and OpenLayers.
